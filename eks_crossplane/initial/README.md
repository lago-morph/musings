# partially completed AWS architecture using Crossplane

I started this, and ran out of steam because it got big.

## prompt.md

This is the file I asked Claude to create to try to encapsulate my prompt after some back and forth.

## tasks.md

The original high level plan created for the project.

## stage1.md

This is the output of stage 1, approach overview and comparison.

## stage2.md

This is the output of stage 2, architecture design.  Has lots of diagrams.

## stage3\_outline.md

Outline of stage3.  At this point was getting unwieldy.  Need to figure out way to structure so it isn't overwhelming.
