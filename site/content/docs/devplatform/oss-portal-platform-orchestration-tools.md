Based on my search, here's what I found for **open-source tools** in these two specific categories:

## **Open Source Developer Portals:**
- **Backstage** - Apache 2.0 (CNCF project)
- **Kratix** - Apache 2.0 (also serves as platform orchestrator)
- **Torii** - GPL-3.0 (from Qovery, but not production-ready)

**That's it.** These are the only truly open-source developer portals I found. Everything else in the developer portal space (Port, Cortex, OpsLevel, Configure8, Rely.io, Atlassian Compass, Roadie, etc.) is proprietary/commercial.

## **Open Source Platform Orchestrators:**
- **Kratix** - Apache 2.0 (Kubernetes-based framework for platform-as-a-product)
- **KusionStack/Kusion** - Apache 2.0 (intent-driven platform orchestrator)
- **KubeVela** - Apache 2.0 (implements Open Application Model)
- **Crossplane** - Apache 2.0 (extends Kubernetes to manage cloud resources)

**Commercial Platform Orchestrators (for comparison):**
- Humanitec - Commercial
- Cloudomation Engine - Commercial

**Key Finding:** The open-source landscape for **developer portals** is extremely limited - essentially just Backstage and Kratix are production-ready. For **platform orchestrators**, there are more options (Kratix, Kusion, KubeVela, Crossplane), though Kratix serves dual purpose as both portal and orchestrator.

The article I found noted that platform orchestrators are a category "for which there are not many open source tools available (yet)," confirming this is a gap in the open-source ecosystem.
