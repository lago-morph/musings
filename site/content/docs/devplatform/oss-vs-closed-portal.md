Based on my research, here are the **open source** tools from that list:

**Fully Open Source:**
- **Backstage** - Open-source framework from Spotify (Apache 2.0 license, contributed to CNCF)
- **Kratix** - Open-source framework for building platform-as-a-product

**That's it - just those two are truly open source.**

All the others are **commercial/proprietary** SaaS platforms:
- Port (commercial, though has some "open commercial" aspects)
- Cortex (closed source)
- OpsLevel (closed source)
- Configure8 (commercial)
- Atlassian Compass (proprietary)
- Rely.io (commercial)
- Roadie (commercial managed service built on top of open-source Backstage)
- Mia-Platform (commercial)
- Cycloid (commercial)
- Northflank (commercial)
- Calibo (commercial)

So if you're specifically looking for open-source options in this space, you're really looking at **Backstage** or **Kratix** as your main choices.
