If you've spent years deploying applications on Unix servers or PC hardware, where each service runs as a single process on a known machine, the shift to distributed systems represents both an operational paradigm change and an architectural evolution. The fundamental difference is deceptively simple: instead of one copy of your service running on one machine, you now have N copies running across M nodes, managed by an orchestrator you don't directly control.",
