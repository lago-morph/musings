# Agent Guidance for XRD Tutorial Project

## Overview

This document provides guidance for AI agents working on the XRD tutorial project. The tutorial reorganization has been completed, and the project is now ready for implementation using the unified specification.

## Project Status: ✅ Reorganization Complete

The tutorial specification reorganization has been successfully completed. All scattered documents have been consolidated into a unified specification following the tutorial-spec-methodology.

## Key Resources

### Primary Specification
- **`.kiro/specs/xrd-tutorial/tutorial-specification.md`**: Complete unified specification
  - Single source of truth for both pedagogical and technical requirements
  - 4-section structure: Learning Architecture → Content Design → Implementation Bridge → Technical Specification
  - Ready for Phase 3 (task creation) in the extended Kiro workflow

### Additional Guidance
- **`.kiro/steering/`**: Directory containing steering files with project-specific guidance
  - Check this directory for additional context, standards, and implementation guidance
  - Steering files provide project-specific rules and patterns to follow
  - Always review steering content before beginning work on this project

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for:
1. **Task Creation**: Use tutorial-specification.md to create implementation tasks
2. **Implementation**: Execute tasks to build the actual tutorial content
3. **Validation**: Ensure educational effectiveness and technical accuracy

## Working with the Specification

When working on this project:
- Use `tutorial-specification.md` as the authoritative source for all requirements
- Follow the extended Kiro workflow (Phases 1-2 complete, ready for Phase 3)
- Maintain focus on educational outcomes alongside technical accuracy
- Ensure learning objectives drive technical implementation choices

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check steering files**: Review `.kiro/steering/` directory for project-specific guidance and standards
2. **Reference the specification**: All requirements and design decisions are documented in tutorial-specification.md
3. **Follow methodology**: The tutorial-spec-methodology provides the framework for educational content development
